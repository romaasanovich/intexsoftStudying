            <description>In 2013, a nuclear war occurred, forcing a large amount of Moscow's surviving population to
                relocate to underground metro stations in search of refuge. Eventually, communities settled within the
                underground train stations and developed into independent states over time. Factions emerged, ranging
                from the independent peacekeepers the `Rangers of the Order`, to the communist `Red Line` faction and
                the fascist `Fourth Reich`, to the more powerful factions such as `Polis`, which contained the greatest
                military power and the most knowledge of the past, and the `Hanza` regime, which controlled the main
                ring of metro stations by its sheer economic power. As these groups began to evolve, the Red Line and
                the Fourth Reich quickly entered a state of war, as both sought to destroy the other. As the war raged,
                the stations who refused to join either side were either demolished by the factions, merged into the
                Hanza regime, raided by criminal bandits, or formed their own independent states. Other stations were
                outright destroyed by animals, mutated by the nuclear fallout. While most of the stations were
                controlled by the 3 main factions
